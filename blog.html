              As I mentioned in my <a href="index.html">about page </a>i'm
              interested in tech and computers in general. So I like to keep
              myself updated with the latest in tech news as much as possible.
              And from time to time I like to write about it and add my own take
              to it. So I came up with this blog to compile my writings for my
              visitors. I hope you like what you read.

                      The world of CPUs has been notoriously busy in recent
                      years making this decision really hard. With intel and
                      AMD's battle for top CPU manufacturer getting more tense
                      over 2020, it's far more difficult to choose a favorite.
                      But in the end there's always a winner and unfortunately
                      for intel, AMD takes the edge ever so slightly in this
                      competition. But I'm only talking about best overall CPU
                      as there could be others that perform better for much more
                      specific tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And the winner is <strong>The AMD Ryzen 5 3600</strong>.
                      Coming in at $199.99, this 6 core/12 thread desktop
                      processor will get you through almost anything and won't
                      bankrupt you in the process. Intel's Core i5-10400F comes
                      in a close second only because it requires a Z-series
                      mother board (more on these in the future) to use memory
                      clocked in higher than DDR4-2666MHz.

                      Solid-state drives are names so, specifically because they
                      don’t rely on moving parts or spinning disks like the
                      traditional hard drives. Instead, data is saved to a pool
                      of NAND flash, whick is made up of what are called
                      floating gate transistors. These transistor are designed
                      to retain their charge state even when not powered up.
                      making them non-volatile memory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In NAND flash, a 0 means data is stored in a cell — it’s
                      the opposite of how we typically think of a zero or one.
                      NAND flash is organized in a grid. The entire grid layout
                      is referred to as a block, while the individual rows that
                      make up the grid are called a page. Common page sizes are
                      2K, 4K, 8K, or 16K, with 128 to 256 pages per block. Block
                      size therefore typically varies between 256KB and 4MB. One
                      advantage of this system should be immediately obvious.
                      Because SSDs have no moving parts, they can operate at
                      speeds far above those of a typical HDD. Sometimes even
                      upto 100x ...

                      A hard drive stores data on a series of spinning magnetic
                      disks called platters and an actuator arm with read/write
                      heads attached to it. This arm positions the read-write
                      heads over the correct area of the drive to read or write
                      information. Because the drive heads must align over an
                      area of the disk in order to read or write data, and the
                      disk is constantly spinning, there’s a delay before data
                      can be accessed.

                    <p>
                      The drive may need to read from multiple locations in
                      order to launch a program or load a file, which means it
                      may have to wait for the platters to spin into the proper
                      position multiple times before it can complete the
                      command. If a drive is asleep or in a low-power state, it
                      can take several seconds more for the disk to spin up to
                      full power and begin operating.
