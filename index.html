                <p>Hello there! I see you've found your way to my site. <br>
                    Feel free to look aroud and make yourself at home. <br>
                    I'm Elias Melaku by the way, and I am a programmer or at least I'm trying to.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>How I started</h3>
                <p>
                I'd been interested in computers since I was 11. Not programming or developing <br>
                but just a general fascination towards them and how they operated. <br>
                By the time I was 17, I decided that I had to be a developer and I started <br>
                reading all about it. By the time I graduated from high school, I had <br>
                no doubts when picking fields. <br><br>
                
                And luckily for me, I ended up getting the field that I wanted.<br>
                So I work now eveyday to beocome better and to know more about <br>
                this great field of study. <br>
            </p>
            <h3 id="goals">My aim</h3>
            <p>
                Now that I have the opportunity to learn about programming and computers, <br>
                I hope that I can one day make a difference in the outlook that people <br>
                in our country have towards computers and automating their tasks. I hope I <br>
                can take part in the revolutionizing of our country's work force to use <br>
                computers to their full potential in every aspect of thier life.
