                <p>Outside of classes or jobs, I (like most people) enjoy glancing <br>
                    at a good book or breezing thorugh an thrilling movie<br>
                    wether its for increasing my general knowledge or for pure entertainment reasons. <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Books</h3><hr>
                <p>
                    I cant say that I read one book per week or month like most "readers", <br>
                    but that is probably because I'm a picky reader and it takes me a while to<br>
                    find a book that I can enjoy. But what I can say is that, if I find a good <br>
                    book, that I may read it countless times. And luckily for me I have found a <br>
                    few of those books and I also had the time and will to read them time and again,<br> 
                    each time reading as if it were one I hadn't read before. <br><br>

                     I am not one to usually borrow books from other people or from the library. <br>
                     If I like a book and find it useful or entertaining I like to have a copy to hand for <br>
                     reference and re-reading (as I mentioned above). I also love to keep my books clean, <br>
                     meaning i dont like writing or underlining on anypart of the book, and this not <br>
                     for a good re-sale value or anytihng, I just like it that way. <br><br>
                     I mostly recommend the books to my friends and acquaintances, so i thought <br>
                     why not share it with the people who came all this way. I hope i can expand this <br>
                     list in the future but for now, here are the top 3 books I've read.

                <p>
                    When it comes to movies though, I am a huge fan. I can say here that I watch a movie <br>
                    every day. I especially like comedy and action movies, and I wouldn't say no to <br>
                    sci-fi movies either. But I can't stand horror movies and not because they're scary<br>
                    or something but because I can't seem to find the point. I also enjoy documentaries<br>
                    and animations as well. I don't know if it is just me, but i feel like the quality of<br>
                    the movies coming out are gradually decreasing and becoming to much of a clich√©, which <br>
                    has led me to watching more TV shows instead.<br><br>

                    Whenever I get some free time I'm not one to refrain from enjoying a good movie or <br>
                    watching a cool documentary. And when it comes to movies, I'm not as picky as I am <br>
                    towards books. So to list my recommendations here would be a huge handfull. So once <br>
                    again I will leave you with my top 3 movies and TV shows.<br>
