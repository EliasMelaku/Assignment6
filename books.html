                        I cant say that I read one book per week or month like most "readers", 
                        but that is probably because I'm a picky reader and it takes me a while to
                        find a book that I can enjoy. But what I can say is that, if I find a good 
                        book, that I may read it countless times. And luckily for me I have found a 
                        few of those books and I also had the time and will to read them time and again, 
                        each time reading as if it were one I hadn't read before. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am not one to usually borrow books from other people or from the lry. 
                        If I like a book and find it useful or entertaining I like to have a copy to hand for 
                        reference and re-reading (as I mentioned above). I also love to keep my books clean, 
                        meaning i dont like writing or underlining on anypart of the book, and this not 
                        for a good re-sale value or anytihng, I just like it that way. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I mostly recommend the books to my friends and acquaintances, so i thought 
                        why not share it with the people who came all this way. I hope i can expand this 
                        list in the future but for now, I'm showing the top 3 books I've read, in each of their respective category, above.

                    <p>
                        When it comes to movies though, I am a huge fan. I can say here that I watch a movie 
                        every day. I especially like comedy and action movies, and I wouldn't say no to 
                        sci-fi movies either. But I can't stand horror movies and not because they're scary
                        or something but because I can't seem to find the point. I also enjoy documentaries
                        and animations as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         I don't know if it is just me, but i feel like the quality of
                        the movies coming out are gradually decreasing and becoming to much of a clich√©, which 
                        has led me to watching more TV shows instead.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whenever I get some free time I'm not one to refrain from enjoying a good movie or 
                        watching a cool documentary. And when it comes to movies, I'm not as picky as I am 
                        towards books. So to list my recommendations here would be a huge handfull. So once 
                        again I will leave you with my top 3 movies and TV shows.
